<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Sanvi. I am a student of Class 7 and I study in a beautiful school where I get to learn many new and exciting things every day. Among all the subjects I learn, one of my favorites is web design. I started learning it recently, and now I really enjoy it a lot.</p>
<p>Web design means creating and designing websites using a computer. I love using the computer because it helps me think creatively and solve problems in fun ways. I feel very happy when I sit in front of the screen and type codes or choose colors, fonts, and pictures to make a webpage look nice. It feels like I am painting something â€” but with a keyboard and mouse!</p>
<p>I have already learned a little bit of HTML and CSS, which are used to build the structure and design of websites. I enjoy writing code and then seeing how the webpage changes because of what I typed. It feels magical! Sometimes, I even show my parents and friends what I made, and they get very happy and proud of me.</p>
<p>In my free time, I watch simple tutorials on web design and try to practice what I learn. I also love reading storybooks, drawing, and listening to music. But working on the computer is still my most favorite activity. I never get bored of it!</p>
<p>I feel lucky that I got the chance to learn web design at a young age. It is not only fun but also very useful. I hope that one day, I will create a big and beautiful website that many people will use and enjoy. Until then, I will keep learning and practicing every day, step by step.
